This is a mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled that changes the behavior of Link's special jumping animations.

They can be made to play more frequently by either being cycled between or by playing randomly.

They can also be disabled entirely, including the vanilla locations where they appear.

You can also enable normal jump functionality during fancy jumps, allowing Link to jump slash, roll on landing, etc. out of these special jumps.

For more details, see https://github.com/Neirn/MMRecomp_FancyJumps"""
