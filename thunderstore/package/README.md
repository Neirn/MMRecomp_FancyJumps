# Fancy Jumps Mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled

![Slide Hopping](https://files.catbox.moe/8g3a9m.gif)

This is a mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled that changes the behavior of Link's special jumping animations.

They can be made to play more frequently by either being cycled between or by playing randomly.

They can also be disabled entirely, including the vanilla locations where they appear.

As a small quality of life feature, you can enable rolling upon landing to mitigate damage during these special jumps. This is OFF by default, which matches vanilla behavior.
